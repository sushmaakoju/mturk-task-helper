        <Text>To complete a keypoint task, you will use the tools provided to click and mark a point at center of bounding box of each object that belong to listed categories. The general but specific listed categories that we grouped into as "all vehicles" are shown in the task interface to the right of the image.
         To achieve accurate center of bounding box of the each object in the image, make sure you use the Zoom tool to zoom in and focus on the area of detail. In the below example, the Zoom tool has been used to draw a point at center of the car:
