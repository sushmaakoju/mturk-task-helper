            <p>This task contains 25 images each containing a vehicle to be classified.</p>

                <li>Select appropriate category from "buses, small vehicles, small trailers, large trailers,
                    specialized, trucks, unknown or a not a vehicle at all"</li>
                <li> that appear and look closer to any of these categories)</li>
                <li>There is a class called as unknown : such as it might just be significant to note it is a vehicle
                    but not significant enough to classify as vehicle classes.</li>

            <p>There are no requested objects in the following negative examples: no Vehicles, no Trailers, no Trucks,
