        <short-summary>
            <p>This task contains 10 small sub-images taken from a single large image.</p>
            <p>Each sub-image is marked with requested objects and needs to be classified to single category.</p>
            <p>For each marked vehicle, select appropriate label.</p>
            <p>The definitions and examples of tasks are provided <a
                    href="https://mturk-s3-cg.s3.amazonaws.com/Classes-Definitions.pdf">here</a></p>
            <p>This is a full task, needs to be completed for all the small images.</p>
            <p>Skipping any single sub-image from labelling task will lead to lesser payment.</p>

        <detailed-instructions>
            <p>By looking at the marked target(s) of interest, select one label:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Refer these guidelines for identifying objects as well as when deciding appropriate labels : <a

                        Guidelines for each class</a></li>
                <li>For distinguishing between large and small trailers, use relative sizes w.r.t adjacent objects and
                    the definition of classes always !</li>
                <li>Select appropriate category from "buses, small vehicles, small trailers, large trailers, specialized, trucks, unknown or a not a vehicle at all"</li>
                <li> that appear and look closer to any of these categories)</li>
                <li>There is a class called as unknown : such as it might just be significant to note it is a vehicle
                    but not significant enough to classify as vehicle classes.</li>
                <li>When in doubt, please do refer this <a

            <p>There are no requested objects in the following negative examples: no Vehicles, no Trailers, no Trucks,
                SUVs, Vans, RVs. So the right option would be to select "not-a-vehicle". For all good examples, refer classes definitions.</p>
