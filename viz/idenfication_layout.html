            <p>This task contains 10 images taken from a single large image.</p>
            <p>Each sub-image needs to be marked at the center points of bounding boxes of requested objects for
                appropriate labels.</p>
            <p>For each image, you need to find all vehicles that appear in that image.</p>
            <p>Then mark the center points of bounding boxes of all the vehicles in the image.</p>
            <p>The definitions and examples of tasks are provided <a
                    href="https://mturk-s3-cg.s3.amazonaws.com/Classes-Definitions.pdf">here</a></p>
            <p>This is a full task, needs to be completed for all the small images.</p>
            <p> Please note marking all vehicles in image is as important as making sure they do belong to our classes

            <p>Skipping any single sub-image or leaving out visible vehicles from this marking task will lead to lesser

        <detailed-instructions>
            <p>Use the point tool to place points on the center of the requested target(s) of interest:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Refer these guidelines for identifying objects as well as when deciding appropriate labels : <a
                        href="https://mturk-s3-cg.s3.amazonaws.com/Classes-Definitions.pdf">Definitions of Classes :
                        Guidelines for each class</a></li>
                <li>Place a point in the center of the item using your mouse over each instance of the target.</li>
                <li> Zoom if you do use a small screen device for this task.</li>
                <li>Do not include parts of the target that cannot be seen, even though you think you
                    can interpolate the whole shape of the target.</li>
                <li>Use the subject's left and right, not yours.</li>
                <li>Avoid shadows, they're not considered as a part of the target.</li>
                <li>For distinguishing between large and small trailers, use relative sizes w.r.t adjacent objects and
                    the definition of classes always !</li>
                <li>Mark all vehicles. (cars, SUVs, cars, Sedan, pickup trucks, trucks, small and large trailers (loaded
                    or not loaded), </li>
                <li>large trucks, buses, vans, RVs, Caravans and specialized vehicles and any other vehicles that appear
                    and look closer to any of these categories)</li>
                <li>There is a class called as unknown : such as it might just be significant to note it is a vehicle
                    but not significant enough to classify to a specific vehicle class.</li>
                <li>When in doubt, please refer this: <a
